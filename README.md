# Book Management System

## Overview

The Book Management System is a web application designed to manage books, reviews, and recommendations using advanced machine learning models. It integrates with AWS for scalable deployment, leverages FastAPI for the backend, and includes machine learning models deployed on AWS SageMaker for book recommendations. The application also provides summarization services for book content and reviews using language models.

## Features

- **User Management**: Register, login, and manage user profiles.
- **Book Management**: Create, view, update, and delete books.
- **Review Management**: Add, edit, and delete reviews for books.
- **Book Summarization**: Automatically generate summaries for books and reviews.
- **Book Recommendations**: Provide personalized book recommendations based on user preferences.
- **Admin Panel**: Manage users, reviews, and data.

## Technologies

- **Backend**: FastAPI, PostgreSQL (Amazon RDS)
- **Frontend**: React (for future development)
- **Machine Learning**: AWS SageMaker for recommendation models, Transformers library for summarization
- **Caching**: AWS ElastiCache (Redis)
- **Deployment**: AWS EC2, RDS, SageMaker, ElastiCache

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Node.js and npm** (for frontend development)
- **AWS Account** with access to EC2, RDS, SageMaker, and ElastiCache

## Local Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-management-system.git
   cd book-management-system
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
    bash
    Copy code
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    Create a .env file in the project root and fill in the necessary environment variables. Use .env.example as a template.
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/dbname
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
5. **Initialize the Database**:
    Run migrations or use the provided scripts to set up the database schema.
    python init_db.py
6. **Start the Backend Server**:
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload

## AWS Deployment
    
1. **Set Up PostgreSQL on RDS**:
    Create an RDS instance with PostgreSQL and update your .env file with the connection string.
2. **Deploy Summarization Service on EC2**:
    Launch an EC2 instance, install necessary dependencies, and deploy the summarization service.
3. **Deploy Recommendation Service on SageMaker**:
    Train and deploy your machine learning model using AWS SageMaker.
4. **Implement Caching with ElastiCache**:
    Set up a Redis cluster on ElastiCache for caching recommendations.
5. **Connect to AWS Services**:
    Update your application to connect to the deployed AWS services.

## Running Tests

1. **Unit Tests**:
    Run unit tests using pytest to verify the functionality of the backend services.
